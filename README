# sb-builder: A CLI to build soundboard websites from Youtube videos

`sb-builder` is a node.js CLI application which helps building soundboards -- webpages with buttons which play sounds when you click on them.

It will help you:

* downloading soundtracks from Youtube videos, 
* extracting sound snippets
* generating soundboards HTML


## Installing

    npm install sb-builder

## Initializing a soundboard

    sb-builder init <NAME>

    NAME: the name of the soundboard


`sb-builder` will create some folders:

* `./sources/` (where the original videos soundtracks will be kept),
* `./sounds/` (for the edited sound snippets) and
* `./tmp/` (a folder for temporary files).

Additionally, a `manifest.json` file will be created to store all the information about the soundboard, its sources and sound snippets. This manifest will be updated each time you download a new soundtrack or create a new snippet, and will be later used to generate the soundboard webpage.

## Adding (downloading) a new source

    sb-builder download <URL>

    URL: the URL of a Youtube video

`sb-builder` will get the video info, and download its soundtrack.

## Create snippet

    sb-builder snip <ID>
    sb-builder snip <URL>

`sb-builder` will open an external sound editing tool to allow you to trim the sound.

    ID: The Youtube ID of the source video soundtrack
    URL: The URL of the Youtube video, including the `t` parameter:
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_HyZ5aW76c

    Options:

        -t MMmSSs, --time MMmSSs        Time location of the start of the snippet
        -d SS, --duration SS            Duration in seconds of the snippet
        -e TEXT                         Transcription or description of the snippet
